# Aug Notes #
Write notes and build 3D relationships between your thoughts and ideas.

## Features ##
Bring your thoughts and ideas to the 3D world:
* Add note tags in a 3D space
* Write in content to the note tags using markdown
* Add lines between note tags to denote relationships
* View your note map from multiple angles

## Installation ##
The repository includes both the server and the client. To use the app, first clone the repository, then run `npm install` in the repository's base directly. Next visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the app in the browser.

## Usage ##
Note tags are placed where the mouse is clicked. They have titles (the tags shown as text in 3D space) and have content, which is not fully visible in the 3D space. Clicking on a tag shows the content and allows editing of both title and content. Lines can be placed between any two tags. Mouse / touches can be used to manipulate the camera by interacting with an empty area. For touchpads, one finger click changes viewing angle, two fingers click pans the camera, and two finger swipe zooms in / out.
